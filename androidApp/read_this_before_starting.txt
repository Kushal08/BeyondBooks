The following points are to be considered while developing the android app:

=> Before beginning the project: start by cloning the repo in your system by : "git clone https://github.com/TheHackstreetBoys/BeyondBooks.git"

=> Minimum sdk version is to be API 15.

=> To know the details about the wireframes such as the color hex code etc used in the wireframes, you can visit "www.fluidui.com" with username: "anjul.ten@gmail.com" or "201352029@iiitvadodara.ac.in" and password: "iiitv" for both the ids.

=> The following points are to be considered for giving ids to the various items in the xml:
	
	Suppose you are working on wireframe 1 and first button from the top, then name it as "wf1_button1" with button number increasing in vertical order i.e the top most button is given the least number. The same procedure is to be followed for other items as well.
